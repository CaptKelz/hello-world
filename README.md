Hello World Project

I am 31 years old and just learning how to code. I am a stay-at-home mom who just moved to the Netherlands this year with my husband. I am also interested in yoga, foreign languages, travel, and sewing. I am hoping to build skills that will allow me to find a job here after my son starts school next year.
